<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-Differentiation is the process by which unspecialized cells become specialized to carry out distinct functions. A stem cell is an unspecialized cell that can divide without limit as needed and can, under specific conditions, differentiate into specialized cells.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-Cell differentiation is the process by which cells become specialized in order to perform different functions. Multicellular organisms begin as just one single cell-a fertilized egg.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-Dedifferentiation is a cellular process by which cells grow in reverse, from a partially or terminally differentiated stage to a less differentiated stage within their own lineage. In general, the phenomenon is manifested by a change in the shape, gene expression pattern, protein expression pattern and function.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-Stem cells are cells with the potential to develop into many different types of cells in the body. They serve as a repair system for the body. There are two main types of stem cells: embryonic stem cells and adult stem cells.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-In order for a cell to differentiate into its specialized form and function, it need only manipulate those genes (and thus those proteins) that will be expressed, and not those that will remain silent. The primary mechanism by which genes are turned “on” or “off” is through transcription factors.
