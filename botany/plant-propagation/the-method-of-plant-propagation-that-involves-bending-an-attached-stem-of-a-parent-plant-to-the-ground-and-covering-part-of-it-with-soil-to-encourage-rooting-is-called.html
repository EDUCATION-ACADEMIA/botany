<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-Layering is a method of asexual propagation in which a stem is made to produce roots while still attached to the parent plant. The parent plant provides the new plant with water and nutrients while the roots are forming. Layering can be used for plants that are difficult to propagate using other methods.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-The development of roots on a stem while the stem is still attached to the parent plant is called layering. A layer is the rooted stem following detachment (removal) from the parent plant. Some plants propagate naturally by layering, but sometimes plant propagators assist the process.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-Asexual propagation involves taking a part of one parent plant and causing it to regenerate itself into a new plant. The resulting new plant is genetically identical its parent. Asexual propagation involves the vegetative parts of a plant: stems, roots, or leaves.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-Simple Layering: Unlike stem cuttings which are taken from the source before rooting has occurred, this technique allows roots to develop on a stem while it is still attached to the source or “mother” plant.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-Layering In this technique, the attached and bent branch of the plant is covered with soil and allowed to root. After the emergence and development of roots that specific part of the plant is cut and allowed to grow as a new plant. This is called ‘layering’.
